## Why was this module created?

This module was created to make it easy to allow color configuration through options. If your application will always use specific colors, we recommend requiring [those modules](#related-projects) directly. If your application requires using most of the colors, we recommend using [ansi-colors][] for faster require times (the colors are inlined). When using only a few colors at a time or allowing users to choose from a few colors, this module will be more efficient due to lazy caching the [underlying modules](#related-projects).

## Usage

```js
var colors = require('{%= name %}');
```

## API
{%= apidocs("index.js") %}
